Even though it would be nice to use ES6 in node, lots of useful features in node, like `require.resolve` do not have a good alternative in ES6, as `import.meta.resolve` is still experimental. Also, when a package is using ES6, commonjs modules are unable to import it, which is like saying that not everyone is good enough for your package to use it. This is a no-go, and as long as there is not enough support for ES6 like mentioned, it should not be used, especially for tooling and setup. In the meantime, actual source code can still be transpiled with babel, and thus you can use whatever your heart desires, import/export, TypeScript, ....

Also, there is no reason to run babel on tooling, just for the sake of e.g. having your config in TypeScript. IDEs are giving great support to enable you to define the TypeScript type in a JSDoc @type tag, and then help you completely, so there is absolutely no reason to complicate the setup of tooling and scripts with extra setup to run them. Keep babel and others for your actual source code, which you will spend most of your time in anyway. Imho, it's nice to see the difference in tooling and actual source code.

Don't use `mjs` and `cjs`, there is no need like mentioned above. Use the `type` property in your package file, and set it to `commonjs` for the time being.
